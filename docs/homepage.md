Besides the obvious pieces on your freelance web identity like popular professional networks, the hiring companies and
client would want to see your personal and unique portfolio website. Freeturn offers a quickly configurable yet
sufficient way to build the summary presentation of your experience and project portfolio.

Please make sure you at least briefly read the [wagtail's editor's guide](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/editor_manual/index.html),

This is the landing page the visitors of your homepage will be seeing at first. Most of the fields are pretty much self
explanatory, yet some elements are calculated on the fly using the data about your current projects.

1. **the title**: put your name, like "Mary Poppins"
1. **claim**: put your claim here "Freelance baby sitter"
1. **social links block**: configure your web identity here. Github, stackoverflow and linkedin are currently supported.
1. **earliest available block**: the next date you accept offers. If left empty, then the next free month beginning is
automatically calculated, so your profile looks up to date.
1. **speed links**: speed links are calling the user to action. *Current project* leads to the last project
in your project portfolio, *to porfolio* encourages visitors to familiarize themselves with your project list and
*request CV* leads directly to the contact form.
1. **picture**: pick the one you think suits best.


Besides that you can configure the color of title and don't forget about the promotion options coming with Wagtail out
of the box. Page title will be used by the search engines to represent your page in the search results, and you would
probably want it to look pretty.
